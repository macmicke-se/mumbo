            <blockquote>"I remember hearing Icelandic for the first time — In written language Icelandic is the almost
                completely the same as Swedish, Danish, Bokmål and Nynorsk (Norway) 1000 years ago. It was just a stream
                of sounds for the first months. Took me quite some time to even hear words. Much longer for technical
                terms and what people actually meant. I'm in this state with German right now. I kinda understand what I
                hear and read, but not everything." </blockquote>
